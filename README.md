# Loan_Sanction_Prediction-Machine_Learning_Project
The project involves data cleaning, preprocessing, and application of various classification algorithms with different hyperparameters. The goal is to identify the best-fit model by evaluating goodness of fit metrics such as the confusion matrix. Achieves a high accuracy of 89.5% using the XG-Boost algorithm, as measured by the F1 Score.
